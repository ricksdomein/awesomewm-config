## Description
Advanced user config for awesome consist of a bunch of widgets, features and tiling schemes. This setup supports sharing tags between multiple monitors.

My motivation behind making this setup was to make it possible so that everything can be controlled with either the keyboard or mouse.

Currently the code is a bit messy and there is a lot of unused code but nonetheless it is very light weight.

This is by far the best workflow experince I have ever had.
